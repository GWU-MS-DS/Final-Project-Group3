(bpd and autism haver)
i dont have any tho. ive been lookig for one for the 22 years ive been alive.
so what do i do know?
its the second therapist in two years that drops me. 
i dont think it’s worth it, to find a reason to stay alive. like i dont care anymore, about anything, life doesn’t excite me anymore.
no utopia is worth to keep living.
what am i supposed to do?
ive been in therapy (different therapists ofc) for almost ten years.
i dont believe in it anymore.
i dont think it works anymore(at least for me).

Found happiness for a little bit, and then a bit more when I met my first and only girlfriend last year, who I loved more than anything and she dumped me and broke my stupid heart. Fuck all prospects apart from that. My only discernible achievements are - oh wait, I don't have any. 

I honestly just get happy at the idea of not having to suffer. It would be a godsend to never have to exist. I just imagine myself walking on a stairway to a place where I am free of the shackles of this pained existence. God, it's just so liberating.",2023-12-07,0
3,Post,18cxe74,"Im going to finally kill myself tonight.It's weird. Because i feel so free, ive been so hurt for so many years, especially recently. but now knowing i have everything set up, i have everything i have that i want to say to everyone written down, i feel like i can finally breathe after years of suffocation. I havent told anyone, and im not going to other than this i guess. but ive ruined multiple lives, i only hurt those that i love and there is and hasnt been a future for me. my brother has always looked down on me, my mom only ever makes me feel like a burden, (  and to be fair no fault on her, i am a mess and always have been and will likely not be getting better) my ex and i are on probation because of me, she doesnt want me anymore, constantly lies to me now and refuses to let me in or have patience so we can try, and i dont blame her, ive hurt her constantly too. the only reason tragedy here in my opinion is my son. not my blood kid, but kind of a step son, ive been there from the day of his birth and i never saw myself as the father type and never wanted it, but being with him mostly everyday has made me fall in love with his silly little self. i love him so much but im not allowed to be in his life, she wont let me, and i get it. besides ive messed up too much already, but other than that, like i said i feel free, i feel like i can breathe again. i have everything set up and after tonight, im going to be finally doing it. i have 2 liters of liquor, 4 ful bottles of pills, and a 4 story high tower. and im going to drink with a friend, leave, and go climb. its beauitufl up there. ive been a few times just to see. and man... the view is great. im  honestly looking forward to this a lot. i guess my only regret is hurting her. but just like everyone else who has ever expereienced me, shes going top be better off in the longrun without me. and ive wanted to do this for years, im really tired of pushing forward for nothing. so thanks for reading i guess. its 9am right now and ive been setting this up for the past 2 days and its finally completed. so after sometimes around 12 tonight around when my friend is off work. itll be my final hangout. thanks for reading guys. sorry if this is a lot or upsetting, it just feels kind of good to let my mind run. see ya.



Edit...: just to help ease the mind of anyone who is/has worried. I'm still here, I'm very embarrassed about it all the attention it's grabbed considering this was simply to get it off my chest for myself. Thanks for the concern you are all very sweet. But this isn't over, it was simply a moment of delay for me. This was all planned and it is still set and not over. I just feel its fair to at least let anyone who was concerned know I'm still here, as artificial as I personally feel it is. Reach out if you want I guess. Goodnight.",2023-12-07,0

I expressed so many times that my anxiety and autism made a ward a bad place for me. I was overloaded, more overwhelmed, and more stressed than when I came in. No help was offered, no activities were on, it was short staffed. 

Yes, they could watch me every hour to check I'm not killing myself, but if I ever was in a low place again, the fear of returning to a place like this (Or worse) would make me extremely reluctant to ask for help, which seems really counter-productive.

9,Post,18arqju,"I am a Zoophile, indecisive whether to kms or go to therapyI am a 21 year-old male and I have been struggling with zoophilic fantasies for about a year now. I have never harmed an animal nor touched them inappropriately. I realize that animals can not consent and I feel very disgusted with myself because of these fantasies.

I think what triggered it all was a combination of being exposed to zoo porn as a child and being sexually harassed in a bar about a year ago. As I understand (take this with a grain of salt, I'm not a therapist) my brain tries to protect itself by creating a sexual scenario where I am completely in control over something defenseless.

I have tried to deal with this myself but even if I managed to not give in to these fantasies for some time, eventually I'd have a day where I would indulge in them, whether just fantasizing or watching porn. I have managed to cut out real zoo porn but that's about it. I feel miserable because of this. I would never hurt an animal but I'm afraid I won't ever be rid of these wishes and I just can't bear with this for much longer. I started self-harming because of it. I often have suicidal thoughts and almost attempted once.

I would prefer therapy to suicide but I'm not sure how to approach a therapist about this and I'm very afraid of being reported as some sex offender. Not because it'll be bad for me but because then my family would know. I don't see a way to continue living if that happens.

30,Post,182r2ky,"Unwanted pregnancyI am having fleeting thoughts of suidical ideation (I have spoken to my therapist about it) but I just can't seem to make them go away.

Just a few days ago I found out I am pregnant. My ex  and I broke up just over a month ago. (We were in a relationship for 4 years) and we are still living together, just handed in our notice to the landlord.

The reason we broke up is because my Uncle and Grandma both died within 3 months of each other and my partner was so selfish, constantly talking about himself and getting worried I was sleeping with other people when I didn't reply for a while (I was just taking time away from my phone - I find it is healthy whilst grieving).

Fast forward to after the break up, I had a one night stand at the guys house and haven't seen the guy since. The baby could be either my ex or the one night stand guy... 

I am considering all my options for the baby but I feel so alone. Just 6 months ago my ex and I were actually trying for a baby so it feels strange to want a baby but not want it at the same time. 

My initial reaction was sad tears and to get an abortion but over the last day I've been thinking about keeping it more. I feel unsupported, both guys know that I'm not sure who the father is. My ex said if it's his he would be excited and support me, the one night stand said he wants an abortion and if I keep it he doesn't want anything to do with it.

The Dr's can't give me an exact conception date and a prenatal paternity test costs $2,000. I can't afford that. 

If I were to decide to get an abortion, it would be my second one, my first one was insanely traumatic and it was from getting raped when I was 19. Although I strangely grieved that baby still I knew it was the right decision. 

I'm 25 now and I run my own business, just about to put a tiny home on my parents farm and I just feel like this is much better timing than my last pregnancy, however the situation is still dire. 

I am terrified of making the wrong decision and I don't know what I want but I feel as if no one wants to be around me right now, I wonder if I'm just better off taking mine and the babies life in one go. I really don't know if I can handle another abortion.

I just want to... write something on the internet... to be remembered by...

I've always been taught by my country's culture, and by extension, the world, that I am a worthless man.I've been taught that I am too short, too poor and too stupid to deserve anything good.I've been taught that I am a worthless, boring, mediocre man that only deserve 8 to 6 jobs with painfully low minimum wage (less than 24,000 Dollars a year).

I once injured my arm from one of my job... and you know what they did?They just fired me without compensation that they were legally obligated to pay.

I was always suicidal, I took ADHD pills and anti-depressants.It felt like I was just walking corpse on auto-pilot, doing same dog shit jobs over and over again just to put money on the table.

I had hobbies, though.I did boxing and archery.

I lived like that until I am 27 years old (I am still 27).But I met someone very special almost two years ago...She taught me that I am someone worthy of friendship, affection and care.She got into a relationship with someone else better than me, but I had no problem with that and I remained as her friend, and I was satisfied with it.

That is until I fucking heard she passed away...  I didn't even get to say goodbye to her...That kind of broke me... It felt like this world just kept taking whatever little stuffs I had left...It was around last June that I decided to kill myself but I didn't want to do it in a small bathroom or inside a car...

I went to Norway hahaha!My logic was that, if I was going to die, I want to spend some good quality time traveling to a country I always loved, and die gloriously.I bought a plane ticket to Norway, I bought a box cutter knife and rented a car, and I just traveled around Norway for like a week.I spent all my life savings + credit card for this, too.

I arrived at Oslo first, visited various tourist attractions.Then I went to Geiranger, then Loen, and then Jotunheimen.I think I visited most of the ""must visit"" tourist attractions that internet suggested.

After all that, I arrived at my final destination, Leirvassbu in Jotunheimen.I felt so lucky that they had spare rooms hahaha.I spent a lovely night in there... I almost forgot how beautiful the natural darkness can be...The next morning, I walked inside Jotunheimen with no map and no food.I didn't plan to return...

I also went out of my way to enter into ""non-walkable area"" where grounds were nothing but sharp big rocks and mudds and rivers, and I injured my self all the way down.

When I thought I had found my perfect resting spot, I tried to slit my wrist with the box cutter knife... but turns out a box cutter knife is not capable of cutting through flesh easily.I tried to cut my wrist for like 20 minutes, and all it did was leave small marks on my left wrist.

I had no choice but to return to the hotel but it was already 6PM by the time I decided to walk back and it was the most exhausting and painful walk (and crawling and climbing) I've ever done in my life.My body was literally running on adrenaline hahahaha.

It was probably around 12AM that I miraculously found a god damn trail... a human trail... a FUCKING walkable road... and I eventually started seeing lights from the hotel.When I arrived at the door step, I momentarily collapsed, and when I entered the hotel, I kind of broke down crying.Hotel staffs fed me, talked to me, and overall was very nice to me.There was this guy Henric, a clerk, that chose to talk to me for like 4 hours talking about different stuffs.

Unfortunately, hotel staffs called 9/11 and I was hospitalized against my will.My memories after entering Ambulance is quite fuzzy due to drugs the EMTs gave me.

I was stuck in a mental hospital 1~2 hours away from Oslo.I don't know where exactly that was, I never bothered to check the location.But I do remember the doctor's name, His name was Alexander (I think).

To be honest, I don't remember much of what happened inside the hospital, but I do remember being bitter and resentful that the 9/11 was called and that I was not allowed to leave the hospital for almost like a week.

I remember talking to bunch of nurses about my inner thoughts, my motivations and what not.I didn't like that they kept opening the door of my room every 1 hour and took away my belongings.It was a vicious cycle... They would ask me ""Do you want to kill yourself?"" and I would say ""Yes"" and then they would keep me few more days until I had to verbally say ""No, I don't want to kill myself"" despite wanting to kill myself.

And all of that only strengthened my belief that I am a mere corporate/government property destined to work dog shit jobs until I die of old age.

Eventually, they called South Korean embassy, I was expecting some sort of punishments but... they took care of the flight ticket back home.It was dreadful coming back... that was not my plan and I had no money left...I immediately tried to kill myself with helium tank... two times... I always woke up with exit bag torn open with my hands, which I do not remember doing it...And then I crashed my car into a fucking BMW....And then my father called me that my dog fucking died, she had to be cremated and I wasn't there to say goodbye to my own dog.I was a terrible owner... I should have given my dog a better life... And I broke down crying again.

After all that, I just gave up on everything including suicide and started playing Resident Evil 4 over and over again like a fucking degenerate.

But... fate is a strange thing... Somehow I managed to meet this Singaporian girl from Hong Kong.She is beautiful, kind hearted, and financially wealthier than me by significant margin.She had to return back to Hong Kong for her job, however.

After that, I found myself a job at Incheon Airport where they needed a fluent english speaker.

We stayed in touch, texting each other and sharing things.She eventually opened up about having connections in financial district in USA and gave me some tips and heads up that ALL turned out to be 100% correct.

I started following her tips with small amounts at first, but then I got cocky and poured all my savings into investing.I started making 1 year worth salary within just 2 months...And guess what my dumbass did...I took out two fucking cash loans (45k dollars) and started investing with them and I did make very good money doing that.

Until... she told me to buy certain \*futures\*...

First 3 times worked just fine, but yesterday, right after I bought into a certain futures, the price dropped like 10 percent and triggered a margin call...

I lost everything yesterday.   
She lost everything, too.

Now, I have 0 money left, 2 huge loans that I cannot pay back.I have no one to talk to about it, no one that can help me about it.She does not communicate with me anymore.

I am so fucking done...

I am tired of finally getting what I \*needed\* and then have all of them be taken away from me over and over and over again.

Isn't this the very definition of insanity?

I even got so cocky that I started buying things I wanted with my credit card, thinking I can always withdraw needed cash from investment anytime I need.

Now I am in debt in total of 50k dollars hahahaha.

I just see no reason why I should continue, to be honest.   
I think I'm fucking done.

Next week, I will buy bunch of Charcoals, portable burner, a tape, and one night at a cheap hotel or a motel.   
And you probably already knows what that means...

I am done, guys.   
I see no way out of this.   
I'm not just talking about money, too.   
I can't handle this anymore.

If you see some news stories from South Korea about a man committing suicide with a charcoal in a rental car, that will most likely be me. 

I thought about doing it at home or a hotel, but research shows it can hurt other people around the area, so I won’t do that.

My only fear is that I might reincarnate into this fucking world...I am not religious by any means but I admit that some weird shit happens occasionally that science cannot just explain.   
And don't get me started with potentially reincarnating as a North Korean baby...   
Fucking hell... that would suck fucking dick...

I wish there would be nothingness after death.   
If not, I would prefer to be in hell, than reborn into this insane world.   
I don't fucking care if I reborn to a rich parents in first world countries.

No, I just don't like to exist.

That is not much to ask, right???

If you read this whole thing, thank you.I just wanted someone... anyone... to know this.

Sigh...

Goodbye, everyone.",2023-11-24,11

If you have thoughts of suicide you better have a detailed plan and packed breakfast lunch and dinner at the local ER because it's going to be a looong ass wait.  Then they probably will talk to you in a hallway because there's no beds available.   It will be an intern or resident.   Then a doctor will come and apologize for the lack of beds available and offer a referral for the following week.  At which you then will sit and wait another hour for a consult that lasts 12 minutes and perhaps a script for effexor.  No follow up but the recommendation that you followup with your family doctor, as if you haven't been on the wait list for 3.5 years waiting for one.
Im so confused when I read about people wishing they had known their loved one needed help.  Wished they had reached out.   Why hadn't they gotten help?

I’m sorry I haven’t replied to some people, but I’ve read every comment and they’ve helped me so much. I’ve decided I’m going home tonight.

The best description I could give right now is that my environment is still sharp, and everything I come into contact with hurts no matter the slightness of it. I’m still very very disregulated (not sure what the proper term is) and I’m finding it very hard to control the many impulses I do have. I haven’t been able to leave my room but I’ve still gotta go another day. I didn’t put it in my post but I suffer from bpd, so anyone else who is feeling like I am please read the comments. They are for you too, and anyone else who wants to take their own life. I might not end up making it much longer, but like I said I’m the previous edit, I’m going to give myself two days at a time, and if that doesn’t help just a day. If I don’t, please take this a pertinent reminder to reach out to absolutely anyone when you need help. Seek medical advice if you can’t protect yourself, and always be kind to others. Yeah you may have bad days, and you may hurt people that you care about, but those bad days don’t make you a bad person. I love you all so very much, and if I could take away the pain that you feel, I would in a heart beat. 

Edit 4: good luck everyone. I can’t do it. I hope all your lives are full of love and life. I really wish I was better but I’m better off dead. If my family ever see this I love you more than anything on this earth, and I wish things could have been different. I’m not going to rely or activists this account anymore as I don’t want to be stopped. Thank you to everyone for their kind words

I’m sorry that you feel that your family don’t care but don’t you think at all that they’d be heartbroken if you killed yourself? And are you sure this is what your brother would want? 

I’m speaking as someone who has contemplated suicide many times. Please give this more thought. Suicide is very final - if you succeed in taking your life - there are no second chances and nobody really knows what will happen when they die. It may be difficult to take in at this moment in time but the feelings you have at the moment may be temporary - you may not always feel like this.  There are people who have been in exactly the same position as you but who somehow found a way to survive and now thrive and have gone on to find happiness and fulfilment in life and to be able to cope with life more easily - they have found alternatives to suicide and were glad that they did not take their own life.

Give yourself the next few days to see whether there are any alternatives, call a helpline, look at some of the websites where other people have felt suicidal but found alternatives to killing themselves. There are alternatives to suicide so give yourself some time to find some support, some help with coping and talk to others about how you are really feeling.

Do whatever you need to do but please rethink this decision.",2023-12-03,4

 I had a relative with hypothyroidism who bled for months on end. Once she was diagnosed with a blood test and treated with thyroid meds it was better. This is just an example.....it also shows it may not be cancer.

 About going to the doctor - I know it sucks and feels violating. When I go, I try to remember that they are doctors looking at a body part, just like any other part, and there is nothing sexual about it. Just like a doctor looking in your ear, for example.

122,Comment,185gtk8,"Hey bud, I hope you’re not done. I hope you can stay here with us. Let me tell you stories as an old lady in my 30s, if you’re open to reading. 

When I was about your age (college age), a friend planned out raping me. He and his roommate roofied and raped me and the other woman going out with them that night (I did not know her and never saw her again). I was too numb and stunned to call the police at the time or the months that followed. I was fighting the urge to off myself then too. But now I think why should else’s actions determine what I do with my life or death? It’s my decision. But I had to fight to live those days. I had breakfast, lunch, and dinner with friends sometimes for days straight to keep myself from hurting myself (that would not have been attempt 1, sadly), and then I had days I couldn’t leave my room. It was hard. My GPA tanked. My “friend” was in one of my classes, so I stopped going. In that same semester, ironically, I was awarded two more merit scholarships by my college from my past academic performance. It stung. 

I’m sorry about your cousin. Is there something you can do to honor them? Visit their grave every month a certain day? Have a portrait made of them? Or even just get a candle of their favorite color and light it daily?

For your car… I’m sorry about that too. It’s so frustrating. My car was broken into once in San Francisco. I felt defeated. My deductible was $500 while fixing the window was $492. Have you been able to cover your window if it’s broken or claim any losses? 

As for your friends, it sounds like it’s time for new ones. The great news about college is more people are eager to make friends at a lot of schools. I know the end of the semester is coming, but have you thought about any clubs to meet more people who could be future friends? Or maybe that’s a solid goal for the beginning of next semester. 

As for your grades, I hope you can find just 1 good TA or professor who will help you. I was TA for two years in college (I was raped after my first semester as a TA). I got a reputation of actually being helpful, and students from other classes would come see me. I would sit with some students for hours. They said they just needed a C to graduate. I told them I make the quizzes and exams, and I can guide them how to study to get an A. Look for the helpers. They’re there.",2023-11-28,8

you sound like you're in a lot of pain. 

I, uh, I don't know your situation exactly but I know when I'm depressed I get a very distorted sense of the past and future, I make predictions that don't hold up at all *and* I have a more pessimistic view of my past than is entirely accurate. So I think there's a good chance that you're remembering your past inaccurately and also seeing your likely future as being more negative than it's likely to be.",2023-11-13,17

I know this is about your s.o. but are you doing okay?
This is a scary situation to be in and I can't imagine the stress you are under trying to keep him off the ledge knowing he's struggling this hard.
Does he have friends that you could reach out to? Reminding someone of their worth is a group effort, and maybe if he is surrounded by the people who love him the most he could see how needed he is.

Depression is a really strong thing to go through and you become so jaded to the damage that it will cause, you convince yourself everyone is better off, and it takes a while to see the reality clearly.",2023-11-12,18

My ex of 3 years (We also had a child together) left me during a mental breakdown and depression i had and ive lived alone since. i know what goes through your head when you feel useless and want to die. Nothing else feels like its the right answer other than suicide when you feel that way. I still feel it almost everyday since ive lost my family.

But I do want to say, He is very lucky to have you by his side. continue to make him feel loved and show him he has purpose on this earth with you and your children together. Id kill to have my family back and use what i learned to be happy with them. 

It may be tough and tiring, and even scary. But please stay by his side. I had no one by mine and i wouldnt wish that on anybody.

One day he never came back in. We looked through the entire yard, checked all the fences, everything we could think of. We could not find him. I went out every day for over a week to look over the yard to see if there was something i missed and never found anything. Sure as shit after 3 weeks of being gone our blind and frail old man came strolling in the back door like nothing happened. To this day we still have no clue where he went or how he got there.
