121,Comment,17zd8r6,I love horses and have spent a great deal of time around. And my favorite thing about them is their duality.

I once had a British passenger in my cabin who, during deplaning, slipped on a safety information card that had been inadvertently dropped in the aisle by another passenger. He fell backwards and landed on an armrest, shattering the hard plastic with his bum. The first words out of his mouth as he lay on the floor was “I’m terribly sorry for the trouble. It seems I lost my footing.” He said he wasn’t hurt, but I had to convince him to file an injury report just in case his spill ended up causing issues later. He was completely gobsmacked that anyone would sue over an accident. He obviously hadn’t been in the US for very long!",2023-11-12,3
