He then goes and puts $4 million in Kraken to buy DogeCoin. However, unlike his stock investments, he liquidates his position for nearly $27 million.

24,Post,17xgmm3,"How to bet on china being fucked?I think china is fucked and will be fucked up completely around the  2030  2035 mark how can I bet on that?


Edit:
Because some tankie is offended in the comments that I dare offend the great chinese state with my personal opinion I will lay out why I personally think that here.


Here is my CHINA IS FUCKED thread...

Their population is rapidly aging, decreasing rapidly and still suffers from the gender imbalance.

On top of thatt, they just admitted that they overcounted their population by 100 million people.

Goodbye consumption-based growth.

Its GDP is vastly overstated. If you think it really is as big as they claim, ask yourself why you believe statistics from a known liar autocracy?

Independent researchers claim it is overstated by as much as 60%. If their research is off by half, it's still 30% overstated! 🤯

Their massive government debt is hidden among provinces and corporations. Remember that in 🤡🇨🇳, all private corporations are ultimately owned by the state.

The government itself has no idea how much debt they have.

As if that debt load is not enough, their signature Belt and Road Initiative is turning out to be a financial debacle, with most countries not being able to pay back the debt. So they will have to write that off eventually. There is just no way around it.

Their unemployment among college graduates is a staggering 25%. So high that the government announced in July that they will no longer publish this statistic. Way to go 🤡🇨🇳

And now comes the craziest part of it all....

A newly published report states that 🤡🇨🇳 has built so much housing that it currently can house 2 billion people. That's TWICE their population!! 🤯

Who is going to purchase that? No one. And remember, their population is shrinking anyways. Their massive debt-financed investment in their housing is going to sink entirely.

30% of China's fake GDP is because of their property sector. 30%! And they have >100% real estate capacity!!

To put that into comparison, 16% of USA GDP is based on real estate. US financial crisis was caused when it had 5% over-capacity.

So China is more than twice ad dependent on real estate and has 20x bigger bubble than we had when our economy melted down

34 of China's 50 biggest property developers are now in default. Data on hundreds more smaller developers is not available

That doesnt include the largest of China's property developer, Everglades, which is about to go into default due to its $341B debt that it can no longer pay back.

Chinese people are no longer buying property. Because they often paid 100% down on apartments that can not be built because there is no money.

It's estimated that over 60 million people paid 100% down on properties that will never be built and their money can't be returned because the developers spent it on unfinished ghost cities.

I've been to many ghost cities in China. Its a sight to behold. Completely unfinished cities that will eventually be taken back by nature.

The largest pyramid scheme in the history of the world is now collapsing in 🤡🇨🇳 and there is nothing their government can do about it

And it gets better...

And since Covid as well as consistent Chinese belligerence, there is a mass rush of western companies diversifying production to India, Philippines, Mexico and Vietnam because China is too risky.

Remember Japan's incredible growth post WW2 that ended up with 35 consecutive years of zero GDP growth? China is going to be like that but on the wildest steroids imaginable.

China is going to suffer from a multi-generational economic debacle.

When they told you they handled Covid better than anyone else? They lied. There are untold millions of people in China who are now dying from it but they hide the statistics

Never-ending that they gifted us Covid, Swine flu and Bird flu in the first place. I'll blame them for ebola just to top it off

""The Chinese Century"" my ass.

More like tHe cHịNèSé cĔntŰrîE



China is more than twice as dependent on real estate and has 20x bigger bubble than USA had when our economy melted down.

Tens of millions of people, if not more, are going to lose their life savings and the government doesn't have enough money to bail them out

when the Chinese people get restless with their leadership, the leadership as they already started doing, will fan nationalism in order to redirect the anger of the people away from them. They are grabbing land (sea areas) and WILL stir up shit everywhere

And more Chinese belligerence towards USA, Philippines and Vietnam and Japan

But that only buys them limited time. People will only overlook their lost life savings for a short while

🤡🇨🇳 will have to choose whether to help it's people or continue to build its military or prop up its economy.

The thing is, it will be in such a massive debt burden that it won't be able to do any of it

Like I said, 🤡🇨🇳 is FUCKED.

Fucked for generations. They've peaked as a superpower before they ever became anything more than just a widely hated regional hegemon.

This unaffordability is primarily attributed to soaring housing prices and increased mortgage rates, which pushed monthly mortgage payments to an all-time high of $2,866 in August, reflecting a 20% increase compared to the previous year.

71,Comment,184lfps,"I used to work in a shoe store and I remember having to retag all the boots with different prices the night before a 50% boot sale. Everything was marked up so after the 50% off they would really be like $5-10 off. For example, a boot that was $40 was retagged to $70 so it would be $35 after the sale. I was still very young at the time and that really opened my eyes to how fake a lot of sales are.",2023-11-26,7

116,Comment,17usawm,"This isn’t the mind boggling finding you think it is.   

So… the top 10% own 89% of the stocks. Everyone’s (white collar) retirement is majorly tied to the stock market.    

Stock market getting screwed means a lot of people retiring poor, a collapsed market, and angry voters. Not to mention the 10% losing a lot of their value.      
Would regulators, politicians, lobbyists, billionaires want this happening? No, they will continue to protect their investments and stonks will always 📈",2023-11-14,14
